      fileModifier: "M",
      datapackage: {
        old: 'datapackage.json file state based on commit From',
        new: 'datapackage.json file state based on commit To'
      }
    };

    const dataDiff = {
      from: 'csv file state based on commit From',
      to: 'csv file state based on commit To',
    };

    const streams = {
      diff: fs.createWriteStream('path-to-output.txt'),
      lang: fs.createWriteStream('path-to-output-for-language.txt')
    };
*/

gitCsvDiff.processUpdated(metaData, dataDiff, streams, function(){
  //console.log("Done!");
  streams.diff.end();
  streams.lang.end();
